51,51,Chile,"This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness.

164,164,Chile,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits.

176,176,Chile,"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors.

But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor.

2924,2924,Chile,"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy.

Hailing from grafted vines originally planted to Chenin Blanc in 1956, this Viognier is superfloral, with oily aromas along with apple blossom, nectarine and apricot.

The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish.

55763,55763,Chile,"There's a lot of oak on this value-priced Chard, to the point that any fruit aromas are blanketed. In the mouth, there's ample acidity affording good cut, while flavors of pear and apple are spiced up by aforementioned forceful oak.

55766,55766,Chile,"After a cheesy opening, the bouquet shows tropical fruits but little more. In the mouth, this is round and heavy, with very ripe flavors of tropical fruits and melon.

55781,55781,Chile,"Dark in color, with minty oak on the nose, this is a medium-to-full, resiny wine with cinnamon and clove outmuscling plum and cherry flavors.

55785,55785,Chile,"A roasted, stalky smelling nose is a touch offputting at first but improves with airing.

55860,55860,Chile,"Crisp, spicy aromas of red fruits matched against oregano, basil and olive notes give this Cabernet a lot of character and points of interest. The palate is tight and well structured, while dark berry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors flow onto a toasty, minty, warm and tannic finish.

56054,56054,Chile,"This is an earthy, somewhat flat wine with herbal berry aromas that fall away in quiet form. A full, grabby palate brings berry, raisin and tobacco flavors, all supported by a modest beam of acidity.

56069,56069,Chile,"Aromas of graphite, chocolate, olive, herbs and berry fruits open this cool-climate Syrah. Laser-beam acidity comes on like gangbusters, while those sharp acids create racy, almost tart flavors of currant and huckleberry.

56302,56302,Chile,"Initially this doesn't distinguish itself. The nose deals typical Chilean Chardonnay aromas of corn and stalks, along with warm-weather fruits. In the mouth, however, this is minerally and intense, with driving acidity pushing flavors of oak, cinnamon, toast and baked apple.

56337,56337,Chile,"Great wine and great value, too. The nose is a blend of floral, graphite and cassis aromas, while the firm and rugged palate is packed with sweet, friendly cookie, chocolate, coffee and berry flavors.

This wine—along with the RdF Cabernet Sauvignon—show immense color and fruit, but also balance, structure and a friendliness that can't be mass produced.

Once you get to the wine itself, it's a bit boxed in and young, but with plenty of berry and cherry fruit.

128748,128748,Chile,"A dark, saturated color is telling, because this is full and smoky on the nose, with aromas of beef jerky, oak and green herbs. Much like it looks, this Carmenère feels full and saturated. Herbal berry and black plum flavors are peppery and lightly green, while notes of tobacco, coffee and carob comprise the finish.",Max Reserva,90,20.0,Aconcagua Costa,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Errazuriz 2015 Max Reserva Carmenère (Aconcagua Costa),Carmenère,Errazuriz
128753,128753,Chile,"A robust nose with cherry and plum aromas is also savory, saucy and spicy.

128859,128859,Chile,"Mildly gassy and barnyardy on the nose, with berry, vanilla and lactic flavors running second. This wine is on the soft, creamy side of the fence. It almost shows some cloying qualities before dialing things back. Still, it could use more definition and structure; as is, it's tasty but a little flat.",Reserva,86,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,MontGras 2007 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,MontGras
128864,128864,Chile,"Melon and candied aromas are sweet, and soon some toasty oak enters the fray. Flavors of candy corn, ripe apples and mango get a boost from the oak, and overall the feel is properly zesty and not too resiny or milky. Definitely a true-blue Chilean Chardonnay with tropical sweetness, so don't expect a facsimile of Burgundy when you twist off the screwcap.",Tribute,86,17.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Caliterra 2006 Tribute Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),Chardonnay,Caliterra
128880,128880,Chile,"Slightly gritty dusty aromas are low on fruit. This feels plump and round, with modest acidity.

128883,128883,Chile,"Medicinal berry aromas are outweighed by a strong blast of clove. While this feels wide and chunky, it's also acidic. Following the nose, this tastes heavily of clove along with plum, currant and raspberry. On the finish, there's no shedding that dominant oak-based clove character.",Gran Reserva,85,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Indomita 2016 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Indomita
128896,128896,Chile,Citrus and match-stick aromas are basic. This feels plump and a bit low on energy.

128899,128899,Chile,"Blackberry and cassis aromas are a touch balsamic but mostly clean. This feels solid and hefty, with slightly overripe black-fruit flavors.

128911,128911,Chile,"Smells neither tropical nor citric as it falls somewhere in the middle of those two common denominators.

128913,128913,Chile,"Opaque in color, with herbal aromas that include graphite, tobacco, sweaty leather and mocha along with floral berry fruits. The acidity is high due to coastal origins, so the blackberry flavors run tangy, with herbal leanings.

128946,128946,Chile,"Plum and cherry aromas are the slightest bit stalky. In the mouth, this coastal Pinot is round and full in feel, with reedy cherry and plum flavors matched by creamy oak.

129011,129011,Chile,"Candied berry aromas are clean and pleasant. This is solid on the palate, with a bit of reduction.

129012,129012,Chile,"Aromas of earthy cherry and plum are herbal in that patented Chilean way. Raw, fresh and with a mouthfeel pushed by acidity, this tastes of salty roasted plum and gamy meat.

129013,129013,Chile,"This is so loud on the nose that it's screaming coastal Sauvignon via sharp, pungent, borderline vegetal aromas.

129102,129102,Chile,"Roasted, balsamic aromas suggest tomato, coffee grinds and a pinch of herbal green in addition to standard berry and cassis notes.

129122,129122,Chile,"Olive and woodspice outmuscle vivid fruit aromas on the nose. The palate is a bit raw and drawing, but it's fresh.
